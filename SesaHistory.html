<div class="select-wrapper"><p class="black-text">Scambi Economici Societa Anonyma (SESA), owned by Baron Ludovic Toeplitz, with the financial backing of Alessandro Vassalo, obtained the Orasso Dongor mining lease in Sirsaim, Goa in 1954 and Sesa Goa Limitada was formed. It was bought over in 1955, with equal shareholding, by Gewerkeshaft Exploration e Bergbau and Ferromin S.p.A., a subsidiary of Finsider S.p.A. (of IRI group), which eventually acquired the other half stake in 1963.
</p>
<p class="black-text" align=left>
Sesa Goa Limitada was incorporated as a private limited company in 1963 under The Companies Act, 1956. In 1979, Sesa Goa Private Limited was formed, with the merger of Sesa Goa Limitada with another mining company in Goa, Mingoa Sociedade Miniera Goesa S.a.r.l. In 1981, Sesa Goa Limited became a public limited company with 60% equity with Indian shareholders. In 1996, Mitsui & Co. Ltd. of Japan acquired Finsider International, along with its 51% stake in Sesa Goa Limited .

In 2007, Vedanta Resources plc, acquired the controlling stake in Sesa Goa Limited from Mitsui & Co. Ltd .

<p class="black-text" align=left>
By 1965, Sesa Goa and Mingoa were incorporated as a private limited company under The Companies Act, 1956. The merger happened in 1979 and the new, unified company was called ‘Sesa Goa Pvt Ltd’. The company went public in 1981 with 42,000 Indian shareholders, holding 60% of its shares and the remaining 40% held by Finsider International, which later became ILVA International. Sesa Goa had started with iron mining as its core business but slowly, it ventured into barge construction in 1984 at Sirsaim, located in the Bardez taluka of North Goa. Since then, the barge construction unit has been developed into a shipbuilding division.[5]

<p class="black-text" align=left>
Growth in the 90s: In 1992, the first phase of a 150,000 ton pig iron plant was commissioned. In the same year, Sesa introduced India’s first low-phosphorus foundry grade pig iron in India and subsequently formalised the business under pig iron division. The pig iron plant is located at Amona, Goa. This plant has an annual production capacity of 250,000 tonnes per annum. Other alliances were formed in the nineties - in January 1995, Sesa Shipping was launched by acquiring transhipper M.V. Orissa. The year also saw the inclusion of 84 new coke ovens. When Mitsui & Co. of Japan bought Finsider International in 1996, it gained 51% stake in Sesa Go. By 1997, Sesa Kembla became a 100% subsidiary of Sesa Goa.

<p class="black-text" align=left>
In 1997, A Narrain mines located in Chitradurga, (Karnataka) were purchased. This mine is currently the company’s second largest mine in India. A Supreme Court directive in August 2011 led to suspension of mining activities in the region. In 1999, Sesa Goa started mining operations in Barbil, which has the fifth largest deposit of iron ore and manganese in the world. They started producing high grade iron ore which was exported from the port towns of Haldia and Paradip.
</p>
<p class="black-text" align=left>
Along with these business ventures, in 1998, the company started the Sesa Community Development Foundation that supported the NCM Sesa Technical School and a new Sesa football academy. The company promoted SESA F.A.
</p>
<p class="black-text" align=left>
Mergers and Acquisitions - 2000 onwards: Sesa Kembla completed the creation of an indigenous and environment-friendly technology that produced high-quality metallurgical coke. This technology generated power[6] as a by-product. In 2002, Sesa Group becomes the first business of its kind to be certified with OHSAS 18001.[7] In 2003, the Sesa Goa equity in Sesa Industries was raised to 88.25%, impacting the shareholding pattern.

<p class="black-text" align=left>
In 2007, Vedanta Resources Plc, a diversified metals and mining group founded by Anil Agarwal, acquired 51% controlling stake[8] in Sesa Goa Ltd. from Mitsui & Co. Ltd. Vedanta Resources is listed on the London Stock Exchange and a constituent of FTSE 100 Index. The deal was worth ?40.7 billion, making it the largest M&A deal in the industry so far.[9] In 2009, Sesa Goa acquired Goa-based Dempo Group’s mining and maritime businesses for ?17.5 billion in an all-cash deal.[3][10] This was the second largest[11] acquisition in India’s iron-ore industry, and it gave Sesa Goa access to Dempo’s 70 million tons of iron-ore mineable resources in Goa. In 2011, Sesa Goa purchased 51% stake in Western Cluster, Liberia for $90 mn.[12] The Liberia Gola Forest Community people who also suffered from the civil war believe that the coming of Western Cluster will help to allievate their sufferin g and provide employment.
